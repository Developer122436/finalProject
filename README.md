# Final Project

The final project of the degree is a research aimed at finding a quick way to search for a word in the text. Me and colleague developed a search algorithm based on K-Mismatch with Dynamic Programming that includes insertions and deletions (Indels) of letters in a word. The project was implemented in Java.

* The project works only on TXT Files.
